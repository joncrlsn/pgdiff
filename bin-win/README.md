### getting started on windows

1. download pgdiff.exe from the release page on github
1. either install cygwin so you can run pgdiff.sh or...
1. manually run pgdiff.exe for each schema type listed in the usage section above
1. review the SQL output and, if you want to make them match, run it against the second db

This project works on Windows, just not as nicely as it does for Linux and Mac.  If you are inclined to write a Windows complement to the pgdiff.sh script, feel free to contribute it or we can link to it.  Even better would be a replacement written in Go.
